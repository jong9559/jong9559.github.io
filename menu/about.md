I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Utah, studying Mathematics(with an emphasis in Statistics), and minoring in Computer Science. My primary interests are in statistical inference methods, probability, and abstract algebra. My goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in one of these three fields.

For my entire life, I've lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America. In my free time, I enjoy light reading, learning about advancements in computer hardware, and learning about obscure subjects. My current obscure subject of interest is [The Warring States of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period).

My preferred pronouns are he/him/his.
