I am an upcoming senior at the University of Utah, studying Mathematics(with an emphasis in Statistics), and minoring in Computer Science. My primary interests are in statistical inference methods, homological algebra, and Galois theory. My goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in one of these three fields.

For my entire life, I've lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America. In my free time, I enjoy light reading, learning about advancements in computer hardware, and learning about obscure subjects. My current obscure subject of interest is [The Qin Unification of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin%27s_wars_of_unification).

My preferred pronouns are he/him/his.
