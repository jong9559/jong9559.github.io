I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Utah, studying Mathematics(with an emphasis in Statistics), and minoring in Computer Science. My primary interests are in statistical inference methods, probability, and topology. 

For my entire life, I've lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America. Unlike others in my state who embrace the red rocks, mountains, snow, lakes, and intense inversions, I spent my youth indoors focused on my studies and some after school programs such as Speech and Debate and First Lego League. Through this time, I accrued a reputation among my teammates as "The Bad Cop" or "The Tyrant." 

In my free time, I enjoy light reading, learning about advancements in computer hardware, and learning about obscure subjects. My current obscure subject of interest is [The Warring States of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period).

My preferred pronouns are he/him/his.
